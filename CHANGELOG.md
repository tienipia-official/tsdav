## v2.0.0-rc.0

**breaking**

- removed `DAVFilter` and `DAVProp`, now all function uses `ElementCompact` as prop and filter directly generated from `xml-js` instead.
- removed related `formatProp`, `formatFilter` and `mergeObjectDupKeyArray` function since they are not needed (These functions were marked as internal so they really shouldn't be causing breaking change).
- removed `DAVNamespaceShorthandMap` and added `DAVNamespaceShort` as a replacement.
- renamed parameter `vCardUrlFilter` of function `fetchVCards` to `urlFilter` for consistent naming.
- collectionQuery now accepts `DAVNamespaceShort` instead of `DAVNamespace`.

**features**

- added `freeBusyQuery` for CALDAV, note this feature is not working with many caldav providers.
